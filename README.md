<h1>H4 Hash</h4>

<h2>One-way functions</h2>

- One-way functions, like the name suggest, atc better in the pre set direction. As in, they are relatively easy to compute but harder to reverse. "Harder" meaning that technically it could be done, but it would take millions of years and countless resources etc.

- A real world example could be breaking a plate into hundreds of pieces. Fixing the plate back to it's original form would take a lot more time than what took to break it.
